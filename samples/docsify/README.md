# Servine Docsify Sample

This sample uses [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/) with HTML5 history enabled to showcase SPA redirection capabilities.

Pretty neat, huh?

## Redirects file

The `_redirects` file is as follows:

```
/*      /index.html     200
```

## Note

Please note that drop-down arrows that are supposed to appear do not due to [this bug](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable/issues/66) in the theme used by this sample.
