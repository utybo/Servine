# Module app

Local HTTP static file server with redirection support.

This application is based on `redirects-ktor` and provides a simple static file server with support for redirection. We insist on this being a **local development server**. It does **not** include security features that are essential for such servers, and should only be used to test out your own applications.

This module is not intended for consumption by external applications.
